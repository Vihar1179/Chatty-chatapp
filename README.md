Step 1 - after Unzipping inside there will be another Zip folder and a text document which you are reading right now read this carefully 
step 1.2 - first open a terminal of the root folder and then pass out npm i and then open another terminal and go to cd frontend path and then pass out npm i so all the required modules will be installed in order for the app to run 

Step 2 - After opening folder you will find two folders One is Chat-App (Where my frontend lies - To open my frontend running you need to open a terminal and start my app by giving npm start to root of my folder then next open another terminal and now press cd frontend to access my other part of project as not all the files are in one folder after you go to my frontend path now press npm start again then the app is gonna start in which case you have to open my 2nd folder named Chatapp(no '-' one you can go and open it directly in any of the IDE and start my spring boot this is when the project will run sucefully)

Step 4 - In the PPT which you will see as soon as you unzip my file you will know about what are things that i used and some important logics on how i did it in code snippets so you will get an idea of project.

Step 5 - Happy Chatting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
